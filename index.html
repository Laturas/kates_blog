            Hi, I'm Katelyn! I'm a software developer from the states. Here you'll find my ramblings, things I'm working on/have worked on, among various other things!
        </p>
        <p>
            I like developing applications and games, but any systems programming is fun. I like to do a lot of things the hard way in C, but dabble in a lot of other languages.
