		<h1 class="item-header">What is Pinetree?</h1>
		<p>
			Pinetree is a desktop mp3 player focused on being extremely responsive, reliable, and easy to use.
			
			All this, while being a tiny package of a single executable with a near-instant completely optional install process
		</p>
		<p>
			I was frustrated with the state of streaming services and wanted to be able to play all of my saved music locally. However, existing solutions lacked what I wanted. Every similar application I found was either paid, filled with ads, lacking in important features, horribly slow and buggy, limited to a specific platform, or some combination of the above.

			I set out to fix all of those.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pinetree has been noted by users to be immediately responsive to user input and fun to use. The application prioritizes a fantastic user experience above all else. It also works entirely out of the box; it can be downloaded and ran with no additional setup by the user.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, the entire project is available for free, including the source code which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Laturas/Pinetree">Github</a>.
