			<h1>
				Pinetree MP3 Player
			</h1>
			<p>
				This is the official download/info page for Pinetree - a lightweight desktop MP3 player application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pinetree was built so that I could track statistics on what music I listen to and such while also escaping the grasp of services like Spotify and Youtube Music.
				There are some admittedly unusual design decisions, as I originally only intended for this project to be used by myself, but it has now been released publicly due to demand.
