					C is my favorite programming language. C is also weird. It's in many ways very different from a lot of other languages.
					It is deliberately a tiny language, with a spec that evolves at a glacial pace. It's meant to be portable to any platform no matter how esoteric the architecture.

					It's a bit funny then that many of the language's features are unreliable and unportable.
				</p>
				<p>
					The adoption of the newest standard (C23) is very slow, with few compilers and toolchains fully implementing it. Some features are more commonly implemented than others.
					So how do we know what we can use and expect to work on other platforms - both now and in the future?
				</p>
				<p>
					That's when I happened across Eskil Steenberg's Dependable C. He argues that a subset of C89 is in fact the ideal way to program C while still having strong guarantees of portability.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now I can finally tell you what this article is about. I certainly respect the goal of portability and do in fact agree with a lot of Steenberg's points, but I will argue against some of his perspectives as I feel that they may have been true in the past but are now outdated.
					My personal subset of C adds a few features of C99, and some features that can be easily worked around on porting.
