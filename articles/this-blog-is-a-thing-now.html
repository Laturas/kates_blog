					I've wanted to start a blog for a while, and I've given it a few attempts previously, but hadn't finished anything until now!
				</p>
				<p>
					After realizing that Twitter (and social media in general, really) is a black hole of human happiness I needed another outlet to post my thoughts and cool stuff I work on.
			
					I originally started this specific iteration of my blog back in January of this year but it took a while before I got something usable. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As has happened previously, I ran into my arch nemesis - overambition. I tried making this blog something far more than it needed to be.

					I realized making new articles was a bit slower than I liked because I'd have to retype the html for the headers.
