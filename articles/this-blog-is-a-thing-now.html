					I've wanted to start a blog for a while, and I've given it a few attempts previously, but hadn't finished anything until now!
				</p>
				<p>
					After realizing that Twitter (and social media in general, really) is a black hole of human happiness I needed another outlet to post my thoughts and cool stuff I work on.

					Originally the blog was going to be specifically oriented around tech stuff but I decided against limiting it to that. Even though it's my primary interest, I figure, 
					if I have other things to write about, why not write about those too? I'm sure someone out there could enjoy my ramblings. And it's my website, damnit!
				</p>
				<p>
					See you around! And I hope you enjoy my page! ^^
