					I've always been an advocate for both reducing your dependencies as much as possible, and understanding the dependencies you <i>do</i> have when necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today, I'll be discussing the most recent instance in which this philosophy has proven to be useful.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Why
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					This blog has a lot of math on it. Ideally, I just want to be able to write LaTeX directly into the HTML and have it render.
					Now, while I have done almost everything with this blog entirely from scratch, I'm not insane enough to write my own LaTeX parser/renderer. That's where Katex comes in, and lets me do just that. It's incredibly simple to use, just include a declaration near the top and be done with it! I can inline latex and just have it render like so:
				</p>
				<p>
					\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi}\]
				</p>
				<p>
					That would be the end of the story. That's where I left it for the past while, but there's one thing that irked me. Katex is a pretty big dependency and I had to load it in every single page load. Even minified and compressed and not counting the css it added more than 70kb to each page request - which while this may not sound like a lot, I was curious if it would be possible to avoid this.
					That thought was spurred on by reading the wonderful article <a href="https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/">Why Your Website Should be Under 14kb In Size</a>. Avoiding the slow start protocol issue by keeping my static blog small would reduce load times especially in areas of spotty connection (which I am in often).
				</p>
				<p>
					Another benefit would be that without Katex, that removes one huge page load time. Every time I load into a page that uses Katex, there's a noticeable delay as Katex goes through the article and does its magic. This makes the page feel less responsive
				</p>
				<p>
					But I couldn't just <i>not</i> use Katex, and it didn't seem like any other Latex rendering libraries avoided these probelms. What else could I do?
				</p>
				<h2>
					And So Began the Preprocessor
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					As it turns out, it's possible to pre-run Katex as a command-line program! This began the new plan: make a program that automatically goes through articles I write and do all of the Katex processing. Then, serve the already processed version statically.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wrote a script that does just that, and it worked wonderfully. That was one less huge request I had to make on each page load and I could immediately feel the improvement. All this while keeping my workflow smooth - requiring only one extra command before publishing. Mission accomplished!
				</p>
				<p>
					Except it never quite ends there does it?
				</p>
				<h2>
					The rabbithole
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Now that I had a preprocessed version of my articles, I could actually peer into what it was doing. What I found was mildly scary, it generates a <i>lot</i> of code.
				</p>
				<p>
					While compression certainly helps (especially since html compresses way better than JavaScript empirically), my space needle article would go from around (uncompressed) 20kb to well over 120kb. That was far from the biggest issue though.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were far bigger issues though. There seemed to be some duplicate logic going on. I first noticed this when I would try copying an equation to clipboard. It would seem to copy the equation twice, and this was consistent across several sites that used Katex.
					While mildly annoying, these duplicates became a serious problem as soon as I implemented an RSS feed for my site. As soon as someone opened an article in an RSS feed reader, once again, the equations would appear twice. I had to get to the bottom of this.
				</p>
				<p>That's where I uncovered my biggest discovery - <strong>Katex actually renders the math twice</strong>. Once in HTML, and once in MathML.</p>
				<p>
					HTML made sense I thought, as after all that's what was being displayed. What was that MathML thing though? This is where I have to disclaim I am still relatively new to web development in the grand scheme of things, I had no idea what it was at the time. For those like me, it's an existing web standard for displaying mathematical notation. 
				</p>
				<p>
					That's right, after all this time, the browser had the capability of directly rendering math! And after a bit of messing about with the devtools, I got the MathML portion to display and it rendered and formatted just as well as the HTML while being way simpler in structure and size.
				</p>
				<p>
					I cannot - for the life of me - figure out why Katex renders it twice. MathML has been a part of the web standards for a long time, all major browsers support it. It used to have support issues but this isn't 2014 anymore! I also read that it was for accessibility reasons, but all the accessibility is done through the MathML, not the HTML. And if RSS feed readers were displaying the equations twice, screen readers would almost certainly have that problem, too. Why not get rid of the HTML entirely?
				</p>
				<p>
					The clear solution is to avoid the HTML. However, writing MathML directly would be agonizing, and I still much preferred LaTeX. So I did the easier approach of having my preprocessor nuke all of the HTML after Katex did its thing, and make the MathML display instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Suddenly the footprint of the preprocessed articles reduced drastically (by around half), while retaining all of the nice formatting that I desired. This also immediately fixed the clipboard issues and feed reader issues. The articles were also completely readable as intended in reader view now - which it was not previously. I could also get rid of a lot of the requests to external CSS that Katex asks for further improving page load speed.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Know Your Dependencies
				</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					By willing to put in a little extra work to understand my tools, I was able to significantly improve my site. I got the following improvements:
				</p>
				<p>
					- Avoiding a bug with doubled math equations <br>
					- Significantly reduced the overhead, improving site load times (more than 2x on average) <br>
					- Made the site more accessible and easier to parse <br>
					- Removed a potential failure point (what if the Katex host went down?) <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					This pattern is consistent. I'll use a tool, I notice something strange or I want to make an improvement, I fall down a rabbithole and I emerge with better solutions or at the very least an understanding of why things are the way they are. Most of the things I've learned about programming has come through this sort of cycle.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a limit, obviously. If you just spend all your time chasing answers to questions that you don't need to know in the moment, you won't actually build anything useful. However, I also think the opposite approach of leaving everything behind black boxes and refusing to understand them leads to terrible software.
